# QRadar API wrapper

This is an attempt at creating a complete library for the QRadar API with error checks before the user makes mistakes. The main issue with the normal API is the folder structure used.

# Todo
* Make it available in easy\_install/pip.
* Create error checks, especially for DELETE and PUT functions. 
* Create examples for how to use it.
* Testing of other than GET and POST functions.
* Have further header information checks.
* Add logging
* Make it work for python 3

# Why it sucks currently
This was done in about four hours, so don't expect it to work properly yet.
